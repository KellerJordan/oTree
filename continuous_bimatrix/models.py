This is a continuous time/continuous space bimatrix game.
Two players can simultaneously choose a mixed strategy for the bimatrix game
defined by the "payoff_grid" variable below. They can change their choice at
any time and that change will be reflected on their counterpart's page. Payoff
is determined by the integrating the instantaneous flow payoffs over time (i.e
the longer you are at a payoff spot, the more it contributes to your final
payoff).
